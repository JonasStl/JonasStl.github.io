I am a doctoral student in Economics at the University of Göttingen and a member of the Research Training Group 2654 Sustainable Food Systems. My work centers on food security, poverty, and nutrition, primarily in low- and middle-income countries.

I am a doctoral student in Economics at the University of Göttingen and the Research Training Group 2654 Sustainable Food Systems. My research focusses on food security, poverty, and nutrition mainly, but not exclusively, in low- and middle-income countries.

I use large, cross-country and geospatial data to examine dietary patterns around the globe. I study affordability of nutritious foods and self-sufficiency patterns at the micro- and macro-level. I explore the concept of poverty and examine which measures are most effective in alleviating it.

I use descriptive, experimental, quasi-experimental, and machine learning approaches for my research.

My research has been supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the European Centre for Advanced Studies (ECAS), and the Joachim- Herz Foundation.
