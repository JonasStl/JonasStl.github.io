I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Göttingen, member of the Research Training Group 2654 Sustainable Food Systems and the Chair of Development Economics and Global Health. I obtained a PhD in Economics from the University of Göttingen. My work focuses on food security and poverty, primarily in low- and middle-income countries.

Drawing on large cross-country and geospatial data, I study dietary patterns around the globe, focusing on the affordability of nutritious foods and the role of self-sufficiency and market dependencies at both micro and macro levels. I also investigate the long-term persistence of these patterns. Additionally, I examine the conceptual foundations of poverty and investigate whether labor market programs can effectively alleviate it.

In my research, I use descriptive, experimental, quasi-experimental, and machine learning techniques. 

My research has been supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the European Centre for Advanced Studies (ECAS), and the Joachim-Herz Foundation.
