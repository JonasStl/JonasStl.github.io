I am a doctoral student in Economics at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and a member of the Research Training Group 2654 Sustainable Food Systems. My work centers on food security, poverty, and nutrition, primarily in low- and middle-income countries.

Drawing on large cross-country and geospatial data, I study dietary patterns around the globe, focusing on the affordability of nutritious foods and the role of self-sufficiency and market dependencies at both micro and macro levels. I also examine the conceptual foundations of poverty and investigate which measures effectively alleviate it.

Methodologically, I employ descriptive, experimental, quasi-experimental, and machine learning techniques. 

My research has been supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG), the European Centre for Advanced Studies (ECAS), and the Joachim-Herz Foundation.
